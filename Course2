-Algorithm Analysis
	-Algorithm analysis is an important part of computational complexity theory, which provides theoretical estimation for the required resources of an algorithm to solve a specific computational problem.
	-Analysis of algorithms is the determination of the amount of time and space resources required to execute it.
	-Usually, the efficiency or running time of an algorithm is stated as a function relating the input length to the number of steps, known as time complexity, or volume of memory, known as space complexity.
